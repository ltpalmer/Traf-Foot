# Traf-Foot

Foot Traffic: How can we give people a more informed decision on restaurant and night-life destinations based on people congestion?

Traf-foot exists for the person who wants to go somewhere like a restaurant, bar, or club, but does not want to deal with a large number of people. Traf-foot will have Google Maps integration so that users will be able to search their destination, see the congestion, and check in themselves to give other users updated information on foot traffic.
